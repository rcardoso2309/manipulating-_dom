        <h2>Fox</h2>
        <p>Foxes are mammals and omnivores belonging to the family Canidae. They are medium-sized vulpids characterized by a long snout and a long, bushy tail. Foxes are known for their intelligence and adaptability, thriving in diverse environments from forests to urban areas.
        <p>
        <p>One distinctive feature of foxes is their oval-shaped pupils, similar to the vertical pupils of felines. This gives them excellent night vision, helping them hunt in low-light conditions. They also have a keen sense of hearing, capable of detecting small animals underground.</p>
        <p>Among the approximately 40 recognized species of foxes, only 12 belong to the genus Vulpes, known as "true foxes," with the red fox being the most common. The red fox is found across the Northern Hemisphere and has adapted well to human presence.</p>
        <p>Foxes communicate using a variety of vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. They are solitary animals, with individuals often seen alone except during mating season or when raising young. Despite their solitary nature, they are highly social within their family units.</p>

        <h2>Squirrel</h2>
        <p>Squirrels are small to medium-sized rodents belonging to the family Sciuridae. They are characterized by their large eyes, bushy tails, and sharp claws, which make them excellent climbers. Squirrels are commonly found in wooded areas, parks, and urban settings.</p>
        <p>Squirrels have strong hind legs and powerful muscles, allowing them to leap between trees and escape predators. Their front teeth never stop growing, which is why they constantly gnaw on objects to keep them from getting too long. They are known for their agility and quick movements.</p>
        <p>There are three main types of squirrels: tree squirrels, ground squirrels, and flying squirrels. Tree squirrels, such as the gray squirrel, are the most familiar and are often seen scampering up trees and foraging for nuts. Ground squirrels live in burrows and are more adapted to life on the ground. Flying squirrels, though they don't actually fly, can glide between trees using a membrane of skin between their limbs.</p>
        <p>Squirrels play a crucial role in forest ecosystems. They help in seed dispersal as they often bury nuts and forget them, leading to new tree growth. Their foraging behavior also helps aerate the soil. Squirrels have a varied diet that includes nuts, seeds, fruits, and occasionally small insects.</p>

        <h2>Bear</h2>
        <p>Bears are large mammals belonging to the family Ursidae. They are known for their robust bodies, shaggy fur, and strong claws. Bears are found in diverse habitats, including forests, mountains, and tundras, across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
        <p>There are eight species of bears, including the polar bear, brown bear, and giant panda. Each species has adapted to its environment, with polar bears thriving in arctic conditions and pandas specializing in bamboo forests. Despite their different habitats, all bears share common traits such as a strong sense of smell and powerful limbs.</p>
        <p>Bears are omnivores, with diets that vary widely depending on the species and season. For example, brown bears in North America consume salmon, berries, and insects, while giant pandas primarily eat bamboo. Bears are known for their ability to stand on their hind legs to reach food or to appear more intimidating.</p>
        <p>Hibernation is a well-known behavior of bears, particularly in species living in colder climates. During hibernation, bears enter a state of reduced metabolic activity, surviving on stored body fat. This adaptation helps them endure the winter months when food is scarce. Female bears give birth during hibernation, emerging in the spring with their cubs.</p>

        <h2>Wolf</h2>
        <p>Wolves are large canines belonging to the species Canis lupus. They are known for their intelligence, social structure, and distinctive howls. Wolves inhabit a range of environments, including forests, tundras, grasslands, and deserts, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
        <p>Wolves live in packs, which are complex social units typically consisting of an alpha male and female, their offspring, and sometimes other related or unrelated wolves. The pack structure is vital for hunting and raising pups. Wolves communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking to maintain pack cohesion and establish territory.</p>
        <p>Wolves are apex predators and have a varied diet that primarily includes large ungulates such as deer, elk, and moose. They are also known to hunt smaller animals and scavenge carrion. Their hunting strategy relies on teamwork, stamina, and acute senses of smell and hearing to track and capture prey.</p>
        <p>The wolf's howl is one of its most iconic features, used for long-distance communication between pack members and as a territorial display. Howling helps to keep the pack coordinated and to warn rival packs of their presence. Despite their fearsome reputation, wolves are generally shy around humans and avoid direct encounters.</p>

        <h2>Monkey</h2>
        <p>Monkeys are primates belonging to the infraorder Simiiformes, found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. They are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and adaptability. Monkeys range in size from small marmosets to large baboons.</p>
        <p>Monkeys are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. New World monkeys, such as capuchins and spider monkeys, live in Central and South America and often have prehensile tails. Old World monkeys, such as macaques and baboons, are native to Africa and Asia and lack prehensile tails but have more advanced social structures.</p>
        <p>Monkeys are highly social animals, living in groups called troops. These groups have complex social hierarchies and communication systems involving vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Grooming is a crucial social activity that helps to strengthen bonds and maintain group cohesion.</p>
        <p>Dietary habits of monkeys vary widely among species but generally include fruits, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, and insects. Some monkeys, like the howler monkey, are primarily folivorous, while others, such as the vervet monkey, are more omnivorous. Their diet often influences their habitat preferences and social structures.</p>

        <h2>Lion</h2>
        <p>Lions are large felines belonging to the species Panthera leo. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are social animals that live in prides, primarily in the savannas and grasslands of Africa. A small population of Asiatic lions can also be found in the Gir Forest of India.</p>
        <p>A lion pride typically consists of related females, their cubs, and a coalition of males. Female lions are the primary hunters, working together to take down prey such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. Male lions defend the pride's territory from rivals and other threats. The pride structure is essential for the survival and protection of the cubs.</p>
        <p>Lions are distinguished by their majestic manes, which vary in color and size and are unique to each male. The mane serves as a display of dominance and attractiveness to females. Lions have a powerful roar that can be heard up to five miles away, used to communicate with pride members and deter intruders.</p>
        <p>Despite their strength and status, lions face numerous threats, including habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect lion populations and their habitats. Lions are iconic symbols of wildlife and play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of their environments.</p>

    <h1 class="title">FAQ</h1>
    <dl class="faq-list">
      <dt>How old are the animals?</dt>
      <dd>Foxes typically live between 3 to 4 years in the wild, although some can live up to 6 years or more if they manage to avoid predators and other dangers. In captivity, where they are protected from these threats, foxes can live up to 10 to 12 years. The lifespan of a fox can vary significantly depending on factors such as species, habitat, and environmental conditions.</dd>

      <dt>They are fantastic?</dt>
      <dd>Foxes are considered fantastic animals due to their adaptability, intelligence, and unique behaviors. They possess a remarkable ability to thrive in various environments, from rural forests to urban areas. Foxes are known for their cunning nature and resourcefulness, often outsmarting predators and finding innovative ways to obtain food. Their playful demeanor and intriguing social behaviors make them fascinating subjects for study and observation.</dd>

      <dt>What's the difference?</dt>
      <dd>Foxes differ from other members of the Canidae family, such as wolves and domestic dogs, in several ways. They are generally smaller in size, with a more slender build and bushier tails. Foxes have distinct facial features, including pointed ears and a long, narrow snout. Unlike wolves, which are pack animals, foxes are more solitary, often living and hunting alone or in small family groups. <br>
        Another notable difference is their diet and hunting techniques. Foxes are omnivorous and have a varied diet that includes small mammals, birds, insects, fruits, and vegetation. They are opportunistic feeders and have been observed using diverse strategies to catch prey, such as pouncing and digging. Additionally, foxes are known for their ability to cache food, hiding surplus food to consume later.
      </dd>

      <dt>How to protect?</dt>
      <dd>Protecting foxes involves several strategies aimed at preserving their natural habitats and mitigating threats. Conservation efforts include:<br>
        Ensuring that forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats remain intact and free from urban encroachment and deforestation. Establishing protected areas and wildlife corridors can help maintain viable populations of foxes.<br>
        Implementing and enforcing laws that protect foxes from hunting, trapping, and poaching. Many regions have specific regulations to prevent over-exploitation and to safeguard endangered species of foxes.<br>
        Raising awareness about the ecological role of foxes and their importance in the ecosystem can foster a greater appreciation and respect for these animals. Educational programs and campaigns can promote conservation efforts and encourage community involvement.<br>
        Conducting ongoing research to monitor fox populations and understand their behavior, health, and ecological needs. Data collected can inform conservation strategies and help address emerging threats.</dd>
